Frisby, Sr. before WWII began and they married soon after his return from serving overseas. She worked as a secretary in New York and Virginia while her husband attended seminary. Together they raised five children and moved to Grosse Pointe in 1962 when Rev. Frisby was called to be the rector of St. John\'s Episcopal Church of Detroit, where he served for the next 25 years. Barbara provided a loving home for her family. She had a positive outlook on life and supported each of her children in their endeavors. She loved to read, knit and cook and became famous for her many batches of snickerdoodle cookies. She was an avid Detroit Tigers and Red Wings fan and enjoyed discussing the outcome of each game. Barbara was devoted to her beloved St. John\'s Church and was very active in many aspects of parish life. She served on the Altar Guild for 50 years, provided treats for countless coffee hours, participated in the Women\'s\' Guild and always welcomed visitors with a friendly greeting and smile. In recent years, it became her mission to call or send a cheery note to any parishioner in need. Barbara was predeceased by her husband Thomas Frisby; is survived by her loving children Thomas, Jr., Barbara (James) Thomas, Sarah (Ralph) Babcock, David (Diane Zedan), and Kathryn (Lawrence Nanni); seven grandchildren, Sarah Jean Babcock, Jason (Angela) Thomas, Kevin Thomas, Jennifer Thomas, Stephen (Lisa) Hellstrom, Scott (Nikki) Hellstrom, and Jeanne Frisby-Zedan; her sister Geraldine (Nan) Beans; her great-grand children, Blake Hellstrom, Brooke Hellstrom, Jameson and Parker Thomas; and four nephews and one niece. Even though Barbara and her sister Nan lived hundreds of miles apart, they kept in touch with weekly phone calls. When Barbara became ill, Nan wrote many letters of encouragement to her dear sister.

Age 87, a former long-standing resident of Plymouth, passed away on August 10, 2014. A private family service was held at Oak Hill Cemetery in Indian River, MI on August 23, 2014. Ed was born in Oxford, OH on December 26, 1926, to Leslie and Ruby Quant. Soon after, the family moved to Valley City, ND, where Ed spent his childhood years, graduating from Valley City High School in 1943. Drafted into the U.S. Navy, Ed served as a Petty Officer Third Class on a minesweeper in the South Pacific during World War II. After his discharge from military service, he enrolled at Cornell College in Mt. Vernon, IA, where he met his future wife Alice Marie Briggs. After graduation the couple was married on June 18, 1949, and moved to Iowa City, IA while Ed earned a Master\'s degree in Labor and Industrial Management from the University of Iowa. His career in the trucking and manufacturing industries caused them to move several times while they raised their children, ultimately settling in Plymouth, MI, where they resided for the last 25 years of their 62-year marriage. While living in Plymouth, Ed was active in the community, working with the Plymouth Literacy Council and the Rotary Club of Plymouth. The one constant in Alice and Ed\'s married life was the log house her father had built in the early 1920\'s just outside of Indian River in the woods of northern Michigan. There they returned with their children and grandchildren for annual summer vacations and shared countless months of their autumn years happily puttering around the house and yard, painting and staining, splitting wood, walking in the woods and rocking on the front porch. After the death of his beloved wife Alice in 2011, Ed moved to Waxhaw, NC, to live with his daughter Barbara and her husband Gerry. Ed was a very kind and generous man, a good listener and a source of wise counsel who was never too busy to make time for others. A born storyteller, he had a knack for seeing and sharing the humor in any situation. Above all, however, he was a loving and supportive husband, father and grandfather, as well as a cherished member of his large extended family. He will be sorely missed by them all and by the many who came to treasure his love and friendship. Ed is survived by three children&#58; Kathleen, Barbara and William; four grandchildren, Christiane, Andreas, Anthony and Richard; and one great-granddaughter, Sina. Memorials may be made in Ed\'s name to the Plymouth Literacy Council or to the Rotary Foundation.','2014-10-05','2452903.eps.jpg',NULL,'','0002452903-01','6320LOE','EDWARD B.','QUANT','OE'),(34676418,'MERTA , RONALD A.

His nieces, nephews, aunts, uncles, Stock (Babington) and Boudreau cousins, coworkers and clients at Nichols Veterinary Clinic in Wayne, Michigan and his friends mark his passing with sorrow. Mike had a special relationship with Aunt Betty and Uncle John Bitner since he worked at their family business before his veterinary studies. Mike was devoted to Grampa Bud Boudreau and spent many happy hours with him. Mike worked with him when he was a teen at the Mercury Beer and Wine store on 7 Mile in Detroit. Mike traveled to the UP with Gramma Duquette Boudreau as they both loved Pelkie, MI and dreamt of sharing a farm there. Mike was a westside Detroiter, but was a farmer at heart and spent his teen summers working on a farm. At Michigan State University, Mike earned three degrees &#150; a Bachelor\'s degree in Dairy Production, a Master\'s degree in Animal Science, and a Doctorate of Veterinary Medicine. Mike worked at Nichols Veterinary Clinic in Wayne, MI for 19 years. Any animal could find loving care or a home with Mike. In his twenties, Mike was diagnosed with ankylosing spondylitis which caused chronic pain in his back and legs, but Mike never grumbled or asked \'why me\'. He pursued and obtained his life goals despite the health obstacles. He had great affection for his John Deere tractors, his ten acres, and the family origin towns of Pelkie and Lake Linden in the Keweenaw Peninsula of the Upper Peninsula. His tenacity, perseverance and his whip-sharp wit will never be forgotten by his brokenhearted family.
